This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Hulu 2.0 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The Hulu 2.0 project is a clone of the popular streaming service Hulu, built using ReactJs, NextJs, Tailwind CSS, and designed to be fully responsive. The goal of this project is to create a functional replica of the Hulu platform with a focus on user experience and modern web development technologies. The use of ReactJs and NextJs will ensure a seamless user experience while Tailwind CSS will provide a clean and modern design.
